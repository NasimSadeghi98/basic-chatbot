# 🤖 Basic Chatbot in Python

This project is a very simple chatbot that responds to basic inputs using conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`) in Python. It can answer greetings, questions about its creator, and more.

## 💬 How it works

- It checks for keywords like:
  - `"hello"` → greets the user.
  - `"your name"` → tells its name.
  - `"how are you"` → responds politely.
  - `"what can you do"` → explains its purpose.
  - `"who made you"` → credits the author.
  - `"thank you"` → gives a friendly response.

## 🧠 Skills used

- Python basics
- `if-elif-else` conditions
- `while True` loop
- String methods (`.lower()` and `in`)
